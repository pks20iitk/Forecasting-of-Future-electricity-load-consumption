# Forecasting-of-Future-electricity-load-consumption
Load Forecasting refers to the process of predicting future electricity load consumption, from historical data. It involves forecasting average load in MW or total load in MWh for blocks of 15’, 30’, hour, day, week, month or year for a daily forecast, weekly forecast, monthly forecast, yearly or multi year forecast. It helps an electric utility to make important decisions including decisions on purchasing and generating electric power, load switching, and infrastructure development. Load forecasts are extremely important for energy suppliers, ISOs, financial institutions, and other participants in electric energy generation, transmission, distribution, and markets. Various factors can also be taken into consideration while forecasting, for instance, weather conditions can be sent as an input in the mathematical foreteller function to improve accuracy parameters in certain scenarios.
